# üí£ Layer7 L7 DDoS (for Layer 7)
- This type of attack directly targets applications.
- The goal is not to "shut down" the network, but the service itself, flooding it with requests.
- These tools target layer 7 of the OSI model, where Internet requests such as HTTP are established.
- By using an HTTP flood type of attack to overwhelm a target with HTTP GET and POST requests.
- An attacker can launch attack traffic that is difficult to distinguish from harmless requests from regular visitors.
 
# üß® Layer4 L4 DDoS (UDP-RAW-TCP-SYN)
- This category includes all those attacks that, for example, use malformed packets (tcp, syn and ack).
- Further down the protocol stack, these tools use protocols such as UDP to send large volumes of traffic to a designated server, such as during a UDP flood event.
- While often ineffective individually, these attacks typically take the form of DDoS attacks where the effect is enhanced by additional attacking machines.
